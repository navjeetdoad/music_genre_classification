# Music Genre Classification in Python

## Overview
This project aims to classify songs into 10 different musical genres usign machine learning. The model learns to recognize patterns in audio features (ex. tempo, spectral contrast, etc.) and predicts the genre of a given track.

## Dataset
The dataset is taken from the GTZAN Music Genre Dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification), which includes Blues, Classical, Country, Disco, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Metal, Pop, Reggae and Rock. The dataset includes the following:
* genres_original, a folder with 100 .wav files of each of the 10 genres that are each 30 seconds long.
* images_original, a folder with 100 .png files (mel-spectrograms) of each of the 10 genres that visually represent each audio file.
* 2 .csv files which contain the numerical features of the audio files.
